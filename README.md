# **Lungcancer-prediction**
This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of individuals having lung cancer based on various risk factors and features. The project utilizes historical data on individuals, including their gender, age, smoking status, and other relevant attributes, to build a predictive model.

** Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to accurately predict the presence or absence of lung cancer in individuals based on their demographic and health-related features. By developing a logistic regression model, we aim to assist in early detection and risk assessment of lung cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information on individuals' gender, age, smoking status, and other relevant attributes. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data quality. The dataset is avilable in "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/lung-cancer"

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Before building the model, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable. We visualized the data using histograms, countplots and heatmaps to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.

**Feature Engineering**

To prepare the data for modeling, we performed feature engineering. This involved encoding categorical variables using label encoding


**Model Development**

We trained a logistic regression model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set. The model learned patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable.

**Conclusion**

This lung cancer prediction project demonstrates the successful development of a logistic regression model for identifying individuals at risk of having lung cancer. The model shows promising accuracy and performance metrics, providing a valuable tool for early detection and risk assessment. With further enhancements and refinements, this project has the potential to contribute to improved lung cancer diagnosis and patient care.
